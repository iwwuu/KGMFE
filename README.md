# KGMFE - KappaGamma Mock File Explorer

This is the source code for the pretend file explorer page found in [kappagamma.xyz](https://kappagamma.xyz/files/)

It is written in vanilla javascript without any external libraries, only utilizing the [Youtube IFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) to mimick music files. This repository was created as an effort to separate the original source code into a separate library. In the process a lot of messy code was rewritten, removing the jquery dependency and simplifying the process to add files.

Check out the [demo page](https://github.com/iwwuu/KGMFE/tree/main/demo) for more details on how to use it.
